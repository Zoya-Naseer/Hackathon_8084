# 💳 **Predicting Bank Term Deposit Subscriptions** 🏦  

## 📌 **Project Overview**  
This project aims to help banks predict which customers are most likely to subscribe to a **term deposit** 📅. By analyzing data from **telephonic marketing campaigns** 📲, we optimize resource allocation, reduce costs, and enhance campaign success rates 🌟.

## 🎯 **Project Objective**  
The goal is to develop a predictive model that determines whether a customer will say **"Yes"** or **"No"** to a term deposit, based on their **profile and past interactions** 🤔.  

---

## 📂 **Dataset Overview**  
The dataset consists of:  

🔹 **Customer Information** – Age, job type, marital status, education, financial history 📅.
